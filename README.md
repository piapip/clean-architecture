# clean-architecture

PassEntering and PassExiting in the RequirementInterface should be splitted into 2 interfaces, it still keeps my D really close to 0. And I'm too lazy to fix the diagram.

Overall, the diagram looks super nice. Understanding how polymorphism works is the key to build up and follow the diagram properly.

Wondering if I should transition all of the interactor package (which is consisted of only interfaces that serves the controller) into the controller.
