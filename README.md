# clean-architecture

PassEntering and PassExiting should be splitted into 2 interfaces, it still keeps my D really close to 0. And I'm too lazy to fix the diagram.

The Controller package is a mess and it should be splitted into way much more classes or even into 2 separated modules to follow SOLID.

Overall, the diagram looks super nice. Understanding how polymorphism works is the key to build up and follow the diagram properly.
